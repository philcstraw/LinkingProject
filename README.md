LINKING

___About___

Linking is a match-3 style game built primarily for Android but is also playable as a desktop game or in a web browser.
It originally aimed to be along the lines of Tetris or Columns but designed around a phone's touch screen. Of course it's evolved somewhat over time.

___How to Play___

- Drag the input across multiple tiles of the same colour to score a "chain".
- "Persistent" tiles have a number associated with them. You have to reduce this number to 0 to score the persistent tile.
- Persistent tiles have a fixed position and do not collapse like normal tiles.
- Scoring a specific number of tiles in a chain will earn you a power up, which appears on the grid. Score a tile with a powerup to activate it. 
- You can see the powerup que on the left side of the screen. 
- Each game mode has it's own selection of powerups along with a required number of tiles to score in order to earn them.
- One of the most useful powerups is "Swap", which you can use to swap the colour of tiles and only requires a chain of 2 to earn. Once a swap powerup is on the grid, tap on it to select the tile and then tap on another tile to swap colours.

___Game Modes___

***Survival***

- You start with 10 moves. Every chain you score depletes the number of moves you have left. Once it reaches 0, it's game over.
- A persistent tile will appear on the board at each level. The total count of all the persistent tiles will add up to the current level you are at. How that level is distributed across all the persistent tiles depends on how many persistent tiles are added, which is random.
- When a persistent tile is scored as part of a chain, the persistent count will be reduced by the number of tiles in the chain.
- Once all the persistent tiles are cleared, you go to the next level.
- For each level, one persistent tile will have the heart icon. Score this tile to increase the number of moves you have left. The number displayed on the persistent tile when it is cleared will be the number of moves added. 
- Try to get to the highest level possible.
- Using the Swap powerup will not reduce the number of moves.

***Containment***

- You have unlimited moves, however each move you take will cause the persistent tile to spread to one of it's neighbours.
- You can only clear a persistent tile by scoring a chain where the number of tiles in the chain is up to or more than the number on the persistent tile.
- Clear all persistent tiles to reach the next level.
- Using the Swap powerup does not count as a move and will not cause the persistent tiles to spread.
